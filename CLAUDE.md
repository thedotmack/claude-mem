## Daily Maintenance

Run a daily version check across all package manifests and upgrade every dependency to its latest version — including major version bumps. Staying on the latest is the goal; do not skip majors.

- Check `package.json` (root) and all nested `package.json` files (e.g. `plugin/`, `openclaw/`) for outdated dependencies via `npm outdated`.
- Upgrade every package to `latest` (use `npm install <pkg>@latest` for each, or `npx npm-check-updates -u && npm install`). Bump majors too.
- Run `npm audit fix` to resolve advisories.
- After upgrades, run `npm run build-and-sync` and verify the worker starts and tests pass. Fix any breakage caused by major bumps in the same change.
- Commit the updated `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files.
