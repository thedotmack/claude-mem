# Fresh Session

## Overview

Use the `<fresh-session>` tag to start a conversation without any historical context from past sessions. This gives you a clean slate when you want Claude to approach a problem without being influenced by previous work.

## How It Works

Add the `<fresh-session>` tag to your first message:

```
<fresh-session>
Help me debug this React component
```

Claude will start the session without loading any observations, summaries, or previous context from the project.

## Use Cases

### 1. Fresh Perspective

When you want Claude to analyze something without bias from past decisions:

```
<fresh-session>
Review this authentication implementation and tell me if there are security issues
```

Without historical context, Claude approaches the code with fresh eyes, potentially spotting issues that were previously overlooked or accepted.

Useful for understanding how Claude approaches problems without domain-specific knowledge.

### 2. Unrelated Tasks

When working on something completely different from your project's history:

```
<fresh-session>
Help me write a blog post about TypeScript generics
```

The project's technical context won't interfere with creative or educational tasks.

### 3. Privacy-Conscious Work

When you want to avoid revealing project details through context injection:

```
<fresh-session>
<private>
Here are some code snippets from a client project
</private>

Can you explain how this pattern works?
```

Combining `<fresh-session>` with `<private>` tags ensures no project information leaks through context.

## Behavior

### What Gets Skipped

When you use `<fresh-session>`:

- **No context injection** - Past observations are not loaded
- **No session summaries** - Previous session summaries are not shown
- **No token economics** - Context cost calculations are skipped
- **No timeline** - Historical work timeline is not displayed

### What Still Works

Everything else functions normally:

- **Observation capture** - The current session's work is still recorded
- **Session summary** - The session will still be summarized at the end
- **Memory search** - You can still manually search past work with the mem-search skill
- **Future context** - This session's observations will be available in future sessions (unless you use `<private>` tags)

## Tag Behavior

### Self-Closing Tag

Both forms work:

```
<fresh-session>
Your message here
```

```
<fresh-session/>
Your message here
```

### Tag Stripping

The `<fresh-session>` tag is automatically removed from your message, so Claude never sees it. It's purely a control signal for the plugin.

### Multiple Tags

You can combine with other tags:

```
<fresh-session>
<private>
Sensitive debugging context here
</private>

Help me fix this bug
```

### Position Matters

The tag only works in the **first user message** of a session. Adding it later has no effect:

```
# First message - WORKS
<fresh-session>
Help me debug this code

# Later message - IGNORED
<fresh-session>
Start fresh now
```

If you want to start fresh mid-conversation, you need to start a new session entirely.

## Comparison with Private Tags

| Feature     | `<fresh-session>`           | `<private>`                |
| ----------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Purpose** | Skip context injection      | Prevent content storage    |
| **Scope**   | Entire session start        | Specific content blocks    |
| **Timing**  | First message only          | Any message                |
| **Storage** | Still captures observations | Blocks observation storage |

### Use Together

Combine both for maximum control:

```
<fresh-session>
<private>
Confidential project details for context
</private>

How would you architect a microservices system for a financial institution?
```

This gives Claude the confidential context it needs without loading past work or storing the sensitive details.

## Best Practices

### When to Use Fresh Session

✅ **Good reasons:**

- Getting an unbiased code review
- Working on unrelated tasks
- Testing without context

### When NOT to Use Fresh Session

❌ **Avoid when:**

- Continuing work from previous sessions
- Debugging issues with project context
- Building on past decisions
- Working with project-specific patterns
- You want Claude to remember past work

### Guidelines

1. **Don't overuse** - The memory system is valuable for maintaining project context
2. **Context helps quality** - Claude makes better decisions with project history
3. **Use for specific cases** - Reserve for situations where fresh perspective is needed
4. **Combine with private** - Use both tags together for sensitive unrelated work

## Verification

To verify the tag is working:

1. Start a session with `<fresh-session>` tag
2. Check that no context is injected in Claude's first response
3. You should NOT see:
   - Timeline of past work
   - Token economics section
   - Session summaries
   - "recent context" header

## Troubleshooting

### Tag Not Working

If context still loads:

1. **Check tag spelling**: Must be exactly `<fresh-session>` or `<fresh-session/>`
2. **Verify position**: Must be in the very first user message
3. **Restart session**: Tag is only checked at session start
4. **Check logs**: Look at `~/.claude-mem/logs/worker-*.log` for errors

### Tag Visible in Conversation

If you can see the `<fresh-session>` tag in Claude's response:

1. The tag stripping is working (it's only stripped from storage)
2. This is expected - Claude may acknowledge or quote your original message
3. The tag won't be stored in observations or user_prompts table

### Still Want Context

If you used `<fresh-session>` but now want context:

1. **Manual search**: Use the mem-search skill to fetch specific observations
2. **Start new session**: Begin a new session without the tag
3. **Ask directly**: Claude can search memories when you ask about past work

Example:

```
[In a fresh session]
User: What did we decide about authentication last week?
Claude: [Uses mem-search skill to fetch relevant observations]
```

The mem-search skill works even in fresh sessions, giving you selective context on demand.
