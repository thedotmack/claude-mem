# Viewer UI

The magic-claude-mem Viewer is a self-contained web interface that provides real-time visualization of your memory stream -- observations, summaries, and prompts flowing through the system as you work.

## Opening the Viewer

Navigate to [http://localhost:37777](http://localhost:37777) in any browser. The worker service must be running, which happens automatically on your first Claude Code session after installing magic-claude-mem.

The viewer is a single self-contained HTML page served directly by the worker service. No additional setup, build step, or dependencies are required.

## Feed Modes

The viewer operates in three distinct modes depending on how you interact with it.

### Live Feed (Default)

When you first open the viewer, it connects via **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** and streams observations, summaries, and prompts in real-time. New items appear at the top of the feed automatically as they are created during your Claude Code sessions.

### Project Filter

Click any project name in the sidebar to filter the feed to that project only. The viewer stays in SSE mode, so new items for the selected project still appear live as they arrive.

### Search/Filter Mode

When you enter a search query or activate any filter, the viewer switches from SSE to **paginated API results**. A result count badge appears showing how many items matched. This mode uses the same HTTP API that powers the MCP search tools.

## Search Bar

The search bar sits at the top of the page and provides full-text search across all stored observations.

- **Debounced input** -- Queries fire after a 300ms delay, so the viewer does not send a request on every keystroke.
- **Result count badge** -- Displays "N+" when additional results exist beyond the current page.
- **Clear button** -- The X button resets the search and returns to the live feed.
- **Loading spinner** -- Appears while a search request is in flight.

## Filter Bar

A collapsible filter panel sits below the search bar. Toggle it open to refine results with structured filters.

### Observation Type Chips

Multi-select filter chips for observation types:

| Chip | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `bugfix` | Bug fixes and error resolutions |
| `feature` | New feature implementations |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring and cleanup |
| `discovery` | Findings and insights |
| `decision` | Architectural and design decisions |
| `change` | General code changes |

### Concept Chips

Multi-select filter chips from the concept vocabulary:

| Chip | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `how-it-works` | Implementation details and mechanics |
| `why-it-exists` | Rationale and motivation |
| `what-changed` | Diffs and modifications |
| `problem-solution` | Issue and resolution pairs |
| `gotcha` | Pitfalls and non-obvious behaviors |
| `pattern` | Reusable approaches and templates |
| `trade-off` | Competing concerns and compromises |

### Show (Item Kind)

A single-select filter for the kind of record to display:

- **Observations** -- Compressed memory records
- **Sessions** -- Session summaries
- **Prompts** -- User prompts captured during sessions

### Date Range

Start date and end date pickers to constrain results to a specific time window.

### Controls

- **Clear all** button resets every active filter at once.
- **Active filter count** badge on the filter toggle button shows how many filters are currently applied.

## Activity Bar (Timeline)

The activity bar renders a **90-day density chart** showing observation volume over time.

- Each day is represented by a vertical bar whose height is proportional to the number of observations recorded that day.
- **Click** a single day to filter the feed to that date.
- **Drag** across multiple days to select a date range.
- Hover over any bar to see a **tooltip** with the exact date and observation count.
- Uses a **colorblind-friendly palette** for accessibility.

## Theme Toggle

The viewer supports three appearance modes:

1. **Light** -- Light background, dark text
2. **Dark** -- Dark background, light text
3. **System** -- Follows your operating system preference

Click the theme toggle button to cycle through modes. The toggle uses **smart skip logic**: when your system preference matches the current explicit theme (for example, you are on Dark and your OS is also set to dark), clicking the toggle skips the redundant "System" option and goes straight to the next distinct appearance.

## Token Analytics Dashboard

The analytics bar sits below the header and provides aggregate token usage metrics for the selected project.

### Metrics

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Read** | Total tokens required to read all observations in the time range |
| **Work** | Total tokens spent on research, building, and decisions that produced those observations |
| **Recalled** | Tokens actually injected into sessions (context that was reused) |
| **Saved** | Work tokens minus recalled tokens — the efficiency gain from memory reuse |
| **Obs** | Total number of observations in the time range |

Each metric card shows a tooltip with a detailed explanation on hover.

### Time Range

A dropdown selector filters analytics by time window:

- **24h** — Last 24 hours
- **7d** — Last 7 days (default)
- **30d** — Last 30 days
- **90d** — Last 90 days
- **All** — All time

### Auto-Refresh

The analytics bar polls the `/api/analytics` endpoint periodically and refreshes when the browser tab regains visibility, ensuring metrics stay current during active work sessions.

## Infinite Scroll Pagination

The viewer loads items incrementally as you scroll:

- In **live feed mode**, older items load as you scroll down past the initial batch.
- In **search/filter mode**, additional result pages load automatically on scroll.
- **Skeleton cards** appear as placeholders while the next batch is fetching.
- A **"No more items"** indicator appears when you reach the end of available results.
