## Draft Execution Plan

### Next Steps

- Review the latest issue timeline and confirm the current problem statement.
- Reproduce the failure and isolate the smallest safe fix.

### Risks

- High-severity changes can regress user-critical flows if scope drifts.
- Ongoing discussion churn can change acceptance criteria mid-implementation.

### Validation Checks

- Run targeted tests for affected areas and verify no new failures.
- Re-check the original report scenario end-to-end.
