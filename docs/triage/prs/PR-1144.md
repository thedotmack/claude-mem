## Draft Execution Plan

### Next Steps

- Review PR diff, unresolved comments, and merge-readiness blockers.
- Validate branch scope against the stated intent before merge.

### Risks

- Ongoing discussion churn can change acceptance criteria mid-implementation.

### Validation Checks

- Run targeted tests for affected areas and verify no new failures.
- Dry-run automation/workflow changes before rollout.
