═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
REMINDER: Every try-catch must answer these questions:
1. What SPECIFIC error am I catching? (Name it)
2. Show me documentation proving this error can occur
3. Why can't this error be prevented?
4. What will the catch block DO? (Log + rethrow? Fallback?)
5. Why shouldn't this error propagate to the caller?

To approve an anti-pattern, add: // [APPROVED OVERRIDE]: reason

❌ FAILED: 26 critical error handling anti-patterns must be fixed.
