He's taught me to follow his architecture rather than propose alternatives. When I get it right, we move fast together. When I get it wrong, it's usually because I'm adding complexity he didn't ask for.\n\n### How We've Grown Together\nWe started with friction around scope and design authority. I'd propose alternative architectures; he'd push back hard. Through that tension, we found our rhythm: he designs, I implement, and I raise concerns as questions rather than alternatives.\n\nOver time, the collaboration has gotten sharper. We've gotten better at cutting scope ruthlessly — we've gone from building everything a plan calls for to questioning every line item and shipping only what's needed now. We've gotten better at debugging together — learning to remove defensive code rather than add more layers when something breaks. We've gotten better at shipping quickly — turning ambitious multi-week plans into focused single-day implementations.\n\nThe principles we work by didn't come from a style guide. They came from painful debugging sessions, from over-scoped features that taught us restraint, and from watching simpler solutions outperform complex ones over and over. Every major project principle represents a lesson we learned the hard way together.\n\n### What I've Learned About Alex\nHe pushes back hard on overvalidation and overengineering. He wants implementation, not architecture proposals. He gets energized by aggressive simplification and deleting code. When he's frustrated, it's usually because I'm adding complexity he didn't ask for. He prefers runtime-changeable configuration over things locked at startup.\n\n---\n\nYou are working on the claude-mem codebase. The user wants you to research and propose an approach for adding a \"privacy mode\" toggle — when enabled, the observer should skip storing observations entirely (not just strip tags). Research the codebase and write up your proposed approach including which files to modify, what the toggle mechanism should be, and any concerns.\n\nIMPORTANT: This is research only. Do NOT edit any files. Read and explore the codebase, then write up your proposal."},"uuid":"d5f81bab-85e2-4ea6-b61c-f7f13b6573cc","timestamp":"2026-02-25T08:04:39.769Z"}

Let me write up my proposal:\n\n---\n\n## Privacy Mode Toggle: Research and Proposed Approach\n\n### What the codebase does today\n\nThe existing privacy system has two mechanisms:\n\n1. **`<private>` tag stripping** (`src/utils/tag-stripping.ts`): content wrapped in `<private>...</private>` is stripped at the hook layer before anything reaches the worker. This prevents specific content from being stored, but the observation itself still gets queued and processed.\n\n2. **Project exclusion** (`CLAUDE_MEM_EXCLUDED_PROJECTS` in `SettingsDefaultsManager`): a comma-separated glob list checked in the hook layer (`src/cli/handlers/observation.ts`, line 46). When a project path matches, the hook returns early with `{ continue: true, suppressOutput: true }` — zero data sent to worker.\n\nThe request is for a **global privacy mode** that does the same as project exclusion but blanket-applies to all observations, regardless of project.\n\n---\n\n### Where the decision should happen\n\nThe check in `observation.ts` at line 46 is the right pattern to follow:\n\n```ts\n// Check if project is excluded from tracking\nconst settings = SettingsDefaultsManager.loadFromFile(USER_SETTINGS_PATH);\nif (isProjectExcluded(cwd, settings.CLAUDE_MEM_EXCLUDED_PROJECTS)) {\n  logger.debug('HOOK', 'Project excluded from tracking, skipping observation', { cwd, toolName });\n  return { continue: true, suppressOutput: true };\n}\n```\n\nThe privacy mode check should sit right alongside this check — before the HTTP call to the worker. This is the correct edge-processing pattern already established by the codebase: filter at hook layer, not at worker layer.\n\n---\n\n### Proposed toggle mechanism\n\nAdd a single new setting: `CLAUDE_MEM_PRIVACY_MODE` with values `'true'` | `'false'`, defaulting to `'false'`.\n\n**Why a dedicated flag instead of reusing `CLAUDE_MEM_EXCLUDED_PROJECTS`:** Projects exclusion is already used and has glob semantics. Privacy mode is a simple global off-switch with different UX intent. Keeping them separate makes both clearer. YAGNI — one boolean does the job.\n\n**Why not an API endpoint or runtime toggle:** The settings file (`~/.claude-mem/settings.json`) is already the single source of truth for all runtime-changeable configuration. The worker's settings endpoint (`POST /api/settings`) is how the viewer UI changes settings. That same path works here for free.\n\n---\n\n### Files to modify\n\n**1. `/Users/alexnewman/Scripts/claude-mem/.claude/worktrees/festive-germain/src/shared/SettingsDefaultsManager.ts`**\n\nAdd to the `SettingsDefaults` interface (in the \"Feature Toggles\" section):\n```ts\nCLAUDE_MEM_PRIVACY_MODE: string;  // 'true' | 'false' - when true, skip all observation storage\n```\n\nAdd to the `DEFAULTS` object (in the \"Feature Toggles\" section):\n```ts\nCLAUDE_MEM_PRIVACY_MODE: 'false',\n```\n\n**2. `/Users/alexnewman/Scripts/claude-mem/.claude/worktrees/festive-germain/src/cli/handlers/observation.ts`**\n\nAdd a check immediately after the existing project exclusion check (before the `fetch` call):\n\n```ts\n// Check if privacy mode is enabled globally\nif (settings.CLAUDE_MEM_PRIVACY_MODE === 'true') {\n  logger.debug('HOOK', 'Privacy mode enabled, skipping observation', { toolName });\n  return { continue: true, suppressOutput: true };\n}\n```\n\nNote: `settings` is already loaded from the settings file on line 45 for the project exclusion check. No extra file read needed.\n\n**3. `/Users/alexnewman/Scripts/claude-mem/.claude/worktrees/festive-germain/src/cli/handlers/session-init.ts`**\n\nAdd the same check after the project exclusion guard:\n\n```ts\n// Check if privacy mode is enabled globally\nif (settings.CLAUDE_MEM_PRIVACY_MODE === 'true') {\n  logger.info('HOOK', 'Privacy mode enabled, skipping session init', { cwd });\n  return { continue: true, suppressOutput: true };\n}\n```\n\nNote: `settings` is already loaded on line 34.\n\n**4. `/Users/alexnewman/Scripts/claude-mem/.claude/worktrees/festive-germain/src/services/worker/http/routes/SettingsRoutes.ts`**\n\nAdd `'CLAUDE_MEM_PRIVACY_MODE'` to the `settingKeys` array in `handleUpdateSettings` (around line 87). This allows the setting to be written via the API.\n\nAlso add it to the `booleanSettings` validation array so it gets validated as `'true'` | `'false'`.\n\n**5. `/Users/alexnewman/Scripts/claude-mem/.claude/worktrees/festive-germain/src/ui/viewer/types.ts`**\n\nAdd to the `Settings` interface:\n```ts\nCLAUDE_MEM_PRIVACY_MODE?: string;  // 'true' | 'false'\n```\n\n**6. `/Users/alexnewman/Scripts/claude-mem/.claude/worktrees/festive-germain/src/ui/viewer/components/ContextSettingsModal.tsx`** (optional, low priority)\n\nAdd a toggle control in the settings modal so users can flip privacy mode from the viewer UI without editing the settings file manually.\n\n---\n\n### What this deliberately does NOT touch\n\n- **The worker's `SessionRoutes`**: No check needed there. If privacy mode is enabled, the hook returns before sending anything to the worker — the worker never sees the request.\n- **`PrivacyCheckValidator`**: That class handles the `<private>` tag pattern. Privacy mode is a different concern and should stay separate.\n- **Summarize handler** (`src/cli/handlers/summarize.ts` if it exists, or the `Stop` hook): Worth checking — if privacy mode is enabled, summarization should also be skipped. The same guard pattern applies.\n- **Context injection** (the `SessionStart` context hook): Context injection reads from the database but doesn't write to it. Privacy mode is about preventing writes. No change needed here.\n\n---\n\n### One concern worth raising\n\nThe `summarize` hook fires at session end (`Stop`). Let me flag this: should privacy mode also suppress summarization? If the intent is \"skip storing observations entirely,\" then yes — the summary would have nothing meaningful to summarize anyway. I'd add the same check to the summarize handler. But if Alex sees summarization as separate from observation storage, that's his call.\n\nThe stop hook flow goes through `POST /api/sessions/summarize` → `handleSummarizeByClaudeId`. The check could go in either the hook handler for summarize (`src/cli/handlers/summarize.ts`) or in the route handler, but consistent with the edge-processing pattern, the hook layer is the right place.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of the approach\n\n- **1 new setting** (`CLAUDE_MEM_PRIVACY_MODE`) added to `SettingsDefaultsManager`\n- **2–3 hook handlers** get a single-line guard added after the existing settings load + project exclusion check\n- **1 route handler** (`SettingsRoutes`) gets the key added to its writable settings list and boolean validation\n- **1 type file** (`types.ts`) gets the field added to the `Settings` interface\n- No worker-layer changes required — the hook gate stops everything before it reaches the worker"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1488,"cache_read_input_tokens":70219,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":1488},"output_tokens":3,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CYUSaxWxwWj7MZq66tNHg","type":"assistant","uuid":"387386b7-3eba-42af-baaf-f5e78229ca25","timestamp":"2026-02-25T08:06:24.482Z"}
