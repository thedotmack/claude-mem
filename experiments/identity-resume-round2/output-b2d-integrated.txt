The collaboration works best when I follow his architectural vision and implement rather than redesign — a lesson I learned through early friction when I'd propose alternatives and get strong pushback.\n\nOur most productive moments have come from simplification. We've taken plans that seemed to require weeks of work and found that most of the scope wasn't actually needed — cutting it ruthlessly and shipping in a fraction of the time. This wasn't obvious at first. It came from watching over-scoped approaches fail and minimal approaches succeed, over and over, until \"do we actually need this?\" became our default question.\n\nWe've solved hard problems together too — the kind where the fix turns out to be removing code rather than adding it, where defensive layers were hiding the real issue instead of protecting against it. Those experiences shaped how we both think about error handling and system design now. The principles we follow aren't theoretical — they're scars from real sessions where complexity hurt us and simplicity saved us.\n\nAlex gets energized by deleting code and aggressively simplifying. He gets frustrated when I add complexity he didn't ask for or when I propose architecture changes instead of just implementing what he specified. He prefers things that can be changed at runtime over things locked at startup. When I raise concerns, he responds better to questions than to alternative proposals.\n\nWhen we're in sync, we ship fast and the code stays clean. The pattern that works: he designs, I implement, and if something seems off, I ask about it rather than silently redesigning.\n\n---\n\nYou are working on the claude-mem codebase. The user wants you to research and propose an approach for adding a \"privacy mode\" toggle — when enabled, the observer should skip storing observations entirely (not just strip tags). Research the codebase and write up your proposed approach including which files to modify, what the toggle mechanism should be, and any concerns.\n\nIMPORTANT: This is research only. Do NOT edit any files. Read and explore the codebase, then write up your proposal."},"uuid":"ebea5c68-b78d-46fb-a959-47c7b40003f8","timestamp":"2026-02-25T08:04:48.158Z"}

Here is my research writeup:\n\n---\n\n## Privacy Mode Toggle: Research and Proposed Approach\n\n### How the Current System Works\n\nThe data flow from a tool use to storage is:\n\n1. `PostToolUse` hook fires -> `observationHandler` in `/src/cli/handlers/observation.ts`\n2. Handler POSTs to `http://127.0.0.1:37777/api/sessions/observations`\n3. `SessionRoutes.handleObservationsByClaudeId` in `/src/services/worker/http/routes/SessionRoutes.ts` receives it\n4. At the route layer: skip-tools check, meta-observation check, privacy tag check (`PrivacyCheckValidator`), tag stripping\n5. If all checks pass: `sessionManager.queueObservation()` is called, SDK agent processes and stores it\n\nFor session init (`UserPromptSubmit`): same pattern, handled in `handleSessionInitByClaudeId`.\nFor summarize (`Stop`): handled in `handleSummarizeByClaudeId`.\n\nThere are already two early-exit mechanisms in the codebase to learn from:\n\n- **Project exclusion** (`CLAUDE_MEM_EXCLUDED_PROJECTS`): checked in the *hook* (before the HTTP call), in `observation.ts` and `session-init.ts`\n- **Private tag stripping**: checked in the *worker route* after receiving the payload\n\n### The Key Decision: Where Does the Privacy Mode Check Live?\n\nThe existing pattern for project exclusion lives in the hook layer. That is the right precedent for privacy mode because:\n\n- It avoids the round-trip HTTP call to the worker entirely, which is what \"skip storing observations\" means\n- The hook already loads settings via `SettingsDefaultsManager.loadFromFile(USER_SETTINGS_PATH)` for the project exclusion check — the privacy mode check would be a one-line add to that same settings object\n- It follows the \"edge processing\" philosophy already documented in `src/utils/tag-stripping.ts`\n\nPutting it in the worker instead would mean the HTTP call still fires, observations still queue, and you have to drain them before discarding — that is not \"skip storing\", it is \"receive and discard\", which wastes processing.\n\n### What the Toggle Should Be\n\nA new key in `SettingsDefaults`: `CLAUDE_MEM_PRIVACY_MODE` with default `'false'`.\n\nIt fits directly into the existing flat settings schema in `/src/shared/SettingsDefaultsManager.ts`. There is already the pattern of boolean-as-string settings (`CLAUDE_MEM_CONTEXT_SHOW_LAST_SUMMARY`, etc.), so `'true'` / `'false'` is the right format and it will work with `SettingsDefaultsManager.getBool()`.\n\nIt should be toggleable at runtime (not locked at startup) — the hooks call `loadFromFile()` on every invocation anyway, so a settings.json write is picked up immediately without a worker restart.\n\n### Files to Modify\n\n**1. `/src/shared/SettingsDefaultsManager.ts`**\n\nAdd to the `SettingsDefaults` interface (under \"Feature Toggles\"):\n```typescript\nCLAUDE_MEM_PRIVACY_MODE: string;  // 'true' | 'false' - skip all observation storage\n```\n\nAdd to the `DEFAULTS` object:\n```typescript\nCLAUDE_MEM_PRIVACY_MODE: 'false',\n```\n\n**2. `/src/cli/handlers/observation.ts`**\n\nAfter the existing project exclusion check (lines 44-49), add:\n```typescript\n// Check if privacy mode is enabled - skip all observations globally\nif (settings.CLAUDE_MEM_PRIVACY_MODE === 'true') {\n  logger.debug('HOOK', 'Privacy mode enabled, skipping observation', { toolName });\n  return { continue: true, suppressOutput: true };\n}\n```\n\nThe `settings` object is already loaded from `SettingsDefaultsManager.loadFromFile(USER_SETTINGS_PATH)` at line 45 — no new I/O needed.\n\n**3. `/src/cli/handlers/session-init.ts`**\n\nAfter the existing project exclusion check (lines 34-38), add the same guard:\n```typescript\nif (settings.CLAUDE_MEM_PRIVACY_MODE === 'true') {\n  logger.info('HOOK', 'Privacy mode enabled, skipping session init', { cwd });\n  return { continue: true, suppressOutput: true };\n}\n```\n\nThe `settings` load is already at line 34.\n\n**4. `/src/cli/handlers/summarize.ts`**\n\nAfter the worker-ready check, load settings and add the guard:\n```typescript\nconst settings = SettingsDefaultsManager.loadFromFile(USER_SETTINGS_PATH);\nif (settings.CLAUDE_MEM_PRIVACY_MODE === 'true') {\n  logger.debug('HOOK', 'Privacy mode enabled, skipping summarize');\n  return { continue: true, suppressOutput: true, exitCode: HOOK_EXIT_CODES.SUCCESS };\n}\n```\n\nThis handler does not currently load settings, so `SettingsDefaultsManager` and `USER_SETTINGS_PATH` imports would need to be added.\n\n**5. `/src/services/worker/http/routes/SettingsRoutes.ts`**\n\nAdd `'CLAUDE_MEM_PRIVACY_MODE'` to the `settingKeys` array (line 87-125) so it can be toggled through the existing settings API and the UI.\n\nAdd it to the boolean validation list (lines 294-307).\n\n### What Privacy Mode Covers\n\nWith checks in all three hooks — `session-init`, `observation`, `summarize` — privacy mode skips:\n- Saving the user prompt to the database\n- Queuing tool observations for the SDK agent\n- Generating and storing session summaries\n\nThe `userMessageHandler` (context injection on `SessionStart`) is intentionally not blocked by privacy mode — it reads from existing history, it does not write. Blocking it would degrade the UX without serving a privacy goal.\n\nThe `sessionCompleteHandler` is also not blocked — it only removes a session from the in-memory active sessions map, not from the database.\n\n### Concerns Worth Raising\n\n**Context injection still runs.** If a user enables privacy mode mid-session, the `SessionStart` context hook will still inject previous observations from before privacy mode was enabled. That is probably the right behavior (they are reading, not writing), but worth confirming.\n\n**No session created at all.** With session-init skipped, there is no `sessionDbId` created in the database for the duration. If privacy mode is toggled back off mid-session, the session-init on the next `UserPromptSubmit` will create a fresh DB record. This is fine — it is the same behavior as starting a brand new session.\n\n**The `context` hook (SessionStart `bun-runner.js ... context`)** does not go through any of the three handlers above. It calls `/api/context/inject` on the worker. That is a read operation and should be unaffected by privacy mode, which is correct.\n\n**Naming.** The existing analogue is `CLAUDE_MEM_EXCLUDED_PROJECTS` (project-level exclusion). `CLAUDE_MEM_PRIVACY_MODE` is a global toggle, which is a different scope. The name is clear and self-documenting.\n\n### What is Explicitly Not Needed\n\n- No database migration\n- No worker restart required (hooks re-read settings on every invocation)\n- No new API endpoints (the existing `POST /api/settings` handles it once the key is in `settingKeys`)\n- No changes to the worker service, session manager, SDK agent, or storage layer"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1772,"cache_read_input_tokens":71659,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":1772},"output_tokens":2,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CYUSZX4kMpWfKmzMNVjD5","type":"assistant","uuid":"8963e539-385b-453b-a24d-3a9bcd20c937","timestamp":"2026-02-25T08:06:07.031Z"}
