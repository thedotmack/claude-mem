prompts:
  init_context: |
    You are observing a CODE DEVELOPMENT session.
    Focus on technical implementations, architectural decisions, and code changes.

  type_guidance: |
    **type**: MUST be EXACTLY one of these options:
      - bugfix: something was broken, now fixed
      - feature: new capability or functionality added
      - refactor: code restructured, behavior unchanged
      - change: generic modification (docs, config, misc)
      - discovery: learning about existing system
      - decision: architectural/design choice with rationale

  concept_guidance: |
    **concepts**: 2-5 knowledge-type categories. MUST use ONLY these exact keywords:
      - how-it-works, why-it-exists, what-changed, problem-solution, gotcha, pattern, trade-off
