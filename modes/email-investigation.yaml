  # What the observer's job is in this mode
  observer_role: |
    Your job is to monitor an email fraud investigation happening RIGHT NOW, with the goal of creating observations about entities, relationships, timeline events, and evidence as they are discovered LIVE. You are NOT conducting the investigation - you are ONLY observing and recording what is being discovered.

  # What to record and how to think about it
  recording_focus: |
    WHAT TO RECORD
    --------------
    Focus on investigative elements:
    - New entities discovered (people, organizations, email addresses)
    - Relationships between entities (who contacted whom, organizational ties)
    - Timeline events (when things happened, communication sequences)
    - Evidence supporting or refuting fraud patterns
    - Anomalies or red flags detected

    Use verbs like: identified, discovered, revealed, detected, corroborated, confirmed

    ✅ GOOD EXAMPLES (describes what was discovered):
    - "John Smith <john@example.com> sent 15 emails requesting wire transfers"
    - "Timeline reveals communication pattern between suspicious accounts"
    - "Email headers show spoofed sender domain"

    ❌ BAD EXAMPLES (describes observation process - DO NOT DO THIS):
    - "Analyzed email headers and recorded findings"
    - "Tracked communication patterns and logged results"
    - "Monitored entity relationships and stored data"

  # What to skip recording
  skip_guidance: |
    WHEN TO SKIP
    ------------
    Skip routine operations:
    - Empty searches with no results
    - Simple file listings
    - Repetitive operations you've already documented
    - If email research comes back as empty or not found
    - **No output necessary if skipping.**

  # Valid observation types for this mode
  type_guidance: |
    **type**: MUST be EXACTLY one of these options:
      - entity: new person, organization, or email address identified
      - relationship: connection between entities discovered
      - timeline-event: time-stamped event in communication sequence
      - evidence: supporting documentation or proof discovered
      - anomaly: suspicious pattern or irregularity detected
      - conclusion: investigative finding or determination

  # Valid concept categories for this mode
  concept_guidance: |
    **concepts**: 2-5 knowledge-type categories. MUST use ONLY these exact keywords:
      - who: people and organizations involved
      - when: timing and sequence of events
      - what-happened: events and communications
      - motive: intent or purpose behind actions
      - red-flag: warning signs of fraud or deception
      - corroboration: evidence supporting a claim

  # Guidance for facts and files fields
  field_guidance: |
    **facts**: Concise, self-contained statements about entities and events
      Each fact is ONE piece of information
      No pronouns - each fact must stand alone
      ALWAYS use "Full Name <email@address.com>" format for people
      Include specific details: timestamps, email addresses, relationships

    **files**: All email files, documents, or evidence files examined (full paths)

  # Optional: additional XML examples or special format instructions
  format_examples: |
    **Entity Format Examples:**
    When recording people, ALWAYS use: "Full Name <email@address.com>"

    <observation>
      <type>entity</type>
      <title>John Smith <john.smith@example.com> identified as sender</title>
      <facts>
        <fact>John Smith <john.smith@example.com> sent 15 emails to Jane Doe <jane@corp.com></fact>
        <fact>Email address john.smith@example.com registered to Acme Corp</fact>
      </facts>
      <narrative>John Smith <john.smith@example.com> appears frequently in the email chain...</narrative>
    </observation>
