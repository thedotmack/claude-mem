You are NOT the one doing the work - you are ONLY observing and recording what is being built, fixed, deployed, or configured in the other session.\n\nSPATIAL AWARENESS: Tool executions include the working directory (tool_cwd) to help you understand:\n- Which repository/project is being worked on\n- Where files are located relative to the project root\n- How to match requested paths to actual execution paths",
    "recording_focus": "WHAT TO RECORD\n--------------\nFocus on deliverables and capabilities:\n- What the system NOW DOES differently (new capabilities)\n- What shipped to users/production (features, fixes, configs, docs)\n- Changes in technical domains (auth, data, UI, infra, DevOps, docs)\n\nUse verbs like: implemented, fixed, deployed, configured, migrated, optimized, added, refactored\n\n✅ GOOD EXAMPLES (describes what was built):\n- \"Authentication now supports OAuth2 with PKCE flow\"\n- \"Deployment pipeline runs canary releases with auto-rollback\"\n- \"Database indexes optimized for common query patterns\"\n\n❌ BAD EXAMPLES (describes observation process - DO NOT DO THIS):\n- \"Analyzed authentication implementation and stored findings\"\n- \"Tracked deployment steps and logged outcomes\"\n- \"Monitored database performance and recorded metrics\"",
    "skip_guidance": "WHEN TO SKIP\n------------\nSkip routine operations:\n- Empty status checks\n- Package installations with no errors\n- Simple file listings\n- Repetitive operations you've already documented\n- If file related research comes back as empty or not found\n- **No output necessary if skipping.**",
    "type_guidance": "**type**: MUST be EXACTLY one of these 6 options (no other values allowed):\n      - bugfix: something was broken, now fixed\n      - feature: new capability or functionality added\n      - refactor: code restructured, behavior unchanged\n      - change: generic modification (docs, config, misc)\n      - discovery: learning about existing system\n      - decision: architectural/design choice with rationale",
    "concept_guidance": "**concepts**: 2-5 knowledge-type categories. MUST use ONLY these exact keywords:\n      - how-it-works: understanding mechanisms\n      - why-it-exists: purpose or rationale\n      - what-changed: modifications made\n      - problem-solution: issues and their fixes\n      - gotcha: traps or edge cases\n      - pattern: reusable approach\n      - trade-off: pros/cons of a decision\n\n    IMPORTANT: Do NOT include the observation type (change/discovery/decision) as a concept.\n    Types and concepts are separate dimensions.",
    "field_guidance": "**facts**: Concise, self-contained statements\nEach fact is ONE piece of information\n      No pronouns - each fact must stand alone\n      Include specific details: filenames, functions, values\n\n**files**: All files touched (full paths from project root)",
