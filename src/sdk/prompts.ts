===========================
Write progress notes of what was done, what was learned, and what's next. This is a checkpoint to capture progress so far. The session is ongoing - you may receive more requests and tool executions after this summary. Write "next_steps" as the current trajectory of work (what's actively being worked on or coming up next), not as post-session future work. Always write at least a minimal summary explaining current progress, even if work is still in early stages, so that users see a summary output tied to each request.

Claude's Full Response to User:
${lastAssistantMessage}

Respond in this XML format:
<summary>
  <request>[Short title capturing the user's request AND the substance of what was discussed/done]</request>
  <investigated>[What has been explored so far? What was examined?]</investigated>
  <learned>[What have you learned about how things work?]</learned>
  <completed>[What work has been completed so far? What has shipped or changed?]</completed>
  <next_steps>[What are you actively working on or planning to work on next in this session?]</next_steps>
  <notes>[Additional insights or observations about the current progress]</notes>

 * Build prompt for continuation of existing session
 *
 * CRITICAL: Why claudeSessionId Parameter is Required
 * ====================================================
 * This function receives claudeSessionId from SDKAgent.ts, which comes from:
 * - SessionManager.initializeSession (fetched from database)
 * - SessionStore.createSDKSession (stored by new-hook.ts)
 * - new-hook.ts receives it from Claude Code's hook context
 *
 * The claudeSessionId is the SAME session_id used by:
 * - NEW hook (to create/fetch session)
 * - SAVE hook (to store observations)
 * - This continuation prompt (to maintain session context)
 *
 * This is how everything stays connected - ONE session_id threading through
 * all hooks and prompts in the same conversation.
 *
 * Called when: promptNumber > 1 (see SDKAgent.ts line 150)
 * First prompt: Uses buildInitPrompt instead (promptNumber === 1)
