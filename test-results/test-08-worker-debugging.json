[{"type":"text","text":"## Twenty Specific Test Queries for Search API Coverage\n*Source: claude-mem://observation/10636*\n\n**Designed concrete test cases covering worker services, architecture decisions, troubleshooting, file tracking, and concept filtering**\n\nTwenty specific test queries were designed to comprehensively validate the unified search API functionality. The queries span all major categories: semantic queries focus on understanding system components (worker startup, SQLite FTS5, hooks, build pipeline), decision queries target architectural rationale (PM2 choice, search architecture, MCP principles), troubleshooting queries seek solutions (worker debugging, hook timeouts, migrations), file-specific queries track evolution (search-server.ts, context-hook, worker-service), concept-based queries filter by knowledge type (patterns, gotchas, discoveries), type-filtered queries segment by observation type (bugfixes, features, decisions), and timeline queries provide contextual history. Each query maps to specific API capabilities including unified search parameters (type, obs_type, concepts, files) and specialized endpoints (/api/decisions, /api/timeline, /api/how-it-works).\n\n---\nType: decision | Facts: Semantic queries test understanding of worker service startup, SQLite FTS5 implementation, hook lifecycle flow, and build pipeline process; Decision queries test retrieval of PM2 architectural choice, search architecture guidelines, and MCP as DRY source principle; Troubleshooting queries test finding bugfixes for worker service debugging, hook timeout problems, and database migration issues; File-specific queries test tracking changes to search-server.ts, context-hook modifications, and worker-service updates; Concept-based queries test filtering by pattern, gotcha, and discovery observation types; Type-filtered queries test filtering all bugfixes, features, and decisions independently; Timeline queries test contextual history retrieval around search architecture work | Concepts: pattern, how-it-works\n\n---\nDate: 11/17/2025, 9:26:45 PM\n\n---\n\n## Build, Sync, and Worker Restart Executed\n*Source: claude-mem://observation/10622*\n\n**Project built successfully with all hooks and services, synced to marketplace directory, and worker service restarted.**\n\nA complete build, sync, and restart operation was executed for the claude-mem project version 6.0.9. The build process compiled all hook scripts, the worker service, the search server, and the React viewer UI with associated assets. The build system used scripts/build-hooks.js to bundle all components, producing optimized output in the plugin/scripts/ directory. After successful compilation, rsync transferred the entire project to the Claude marketplace plugin directory (~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/thedotmack/), removing any files not present in the source with the --delete flag. The operation concluded with npm install to ensure all dependencies were properly installed in the marketplace location, preparing the plugin for use.\n\n---\nType: change | Facts: Project version is 6.0.9; Build output includes context-hook (38.29 KB), new-hook (32.14 KB), save-hook (32.49 KB), summary-hook (34.61 KB), cleanup-hook (31.38 KB), and user-message-hook (2.24 KB); Worker service built at 1337.16 KB; Search server built at 331.02 KB; React viewer built successfully with viewer-bundle.js, viewer.html, font assets, and 4 icon SVG files; Project synced from /Users/alexnewman/Scripts/claude-mem to ~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/thedotmack/ using rsync with delete flag; Transfer included 11751 files with npm install executed in target directory | Concepts: what-changed, how-it-works | Files: plugin/scripts/context-hook.js, plugin/scripts/new-hook.js, plugin/scripts/save-hook.js, plugin/scripts/summary-hook.js, plugin/scripts/cleanup-hook.js, plugin/scripts/user-message-hook.js, plugin/scripts/worker-service.cjs, plugin/scripts/search-server.mjs, plugin/ui/viewer-bundle.js, plugin/ui/viewer.html\n\n---\nDate: 11/17/2025, 9:16:40 PM\n\n---\n\n## Phase 3 Testing Initiated\n*Source: claude-mem://observation/10528*\n\n**Beginning phase 3 testing with the feature enabled and worker process running.**\n\nPhase 3 testing has begun with the necessary components in place. The phase 3 feature has been enabled in the system configuration, and the associated worker process is confirmed to be running. This represents a transition from development/configuration to active testing of phase 3 functionality. The testing phase will validate that the enabled feature and running worker interact correctly and perform as expected.\n\n---\nType: change | Facts: Phase 3 testing has been initiated; Phase 3 feature is currently enabled; Worker process is running and operational | Concepts: what-changed, how-it-works\n\n---\nDate: 11/17/2025, 7:02:59 PM\n\n---\n\n## Worker Service REST API Endpoints\n*Source: claude-mem://observation/10068*\n\n**Worker service exposes 28 REST endpoints for session management, observations, search, and context retrieval.**\n\nThe worker service implements a comprehensive REST API surface for the claude-mem system. The endpoints are organized into logical groupings: basic health/status (3), session management (5), data retrieval (5), configuration (2), MCP integration (2), search capabilities (6), and context/timeline queries (4). Each endpoint uses explicit method binding (this.handleXxx.bind(this)) for request handling. The API supports both observation-level operations and session-level aggregations, enabling the SDK integration to push memories during execution and retrieve contextual information on demand. The presence of multiple search and context endpoints suggests sophisticated querying capabilities for finding relevant historical information during agent execution.\n\n---\nType: discovery | Facts: Worker service file located at /Users/alexnewman/Scripts/claude-mem/src/services/worker-service.ts; Three GET endpoints for basic service info: /health, / (viewer UI), /stream (SSE); Five POST/GET endpoints for session lifecycle: /sessions/:sessionDbId/{init, observations, summarize, status, complete}; Five GET endpoints for data retrieval: /api/{observations, summaries, prompts, stats, processing-status}; Two POST endpoints for configuration: /api/processing and /api/settings; Two GET endpoints for MCP integration: /api/mcp/{status, toggle}; Six GET endpoints for search functionality: /api/search/{observations, sessions, prompts, by-concept, by-file, by-type}; Four GET endpoints for context and timeline: /api/context/{recent, timeline}, /api/timeline/by-query, /api/search/help | Concepts: how-it-works, why-it-exists | Files: /Users/alexnewman/Scripts/claude-mem/src/services/worker-service.ts\n\n---\nDate: 11/17/2025, 12:42:24 AM\n\n---\n\n## Successfully built context-hook with version 6.0.4 cleanup notice\n*Source: claude-mem://observation/9907*\n\n**Compiled TypeScript hooks including the updated context-hook with MCP server cleanup message.**\n\nThe build process successfully compiled all hooks and services, including the updated context-hook that now contains the version 6.0.4 cleanup notice about MCP server processes. The build output shows all components compiled without errors, with the context-hook output file at plugin/scripts/context-hook.js. This confirms that the TypeScript code modification was syntactically correct and properly integrated into the build system. The cleanup notice is now part of the compiled hook that will be executed during SessionStart events to display the MCP server diagnostic and cleanup instructions to users.\n\n---\nType: change | Facts: Build command executed: npm run build; Build script: node scripts/build-hooks.js; Project version: 6.0.4; context-hook compiled successfully and output as plugin/scripts/context-hook.js (39.31 KB).; All 6 hooks compiled without errors: context-hook, new-hook, save-hook, summary-hook, cleanup-hook, user-message-hook.; Worker service built: worker-service.cjs (1334.65 KB).; React viewer built as plugin/ui/viewer-bundle.js with HTML and font assets.; Build completed with no stderr output, indicating successful compilation. | Concepts: what-changed | Files: plugin/scripts/context-hook.js\n\n---\nDate: 11/16/2025, 10:24:05 PM"}]
