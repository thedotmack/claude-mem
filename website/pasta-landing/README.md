- **Recipe Tabs**: Switch between different memory compression "recipes"
- **Layer Visualization**: Interactive lasagna layers showing vector embeddings
- **Memory Bytes**: Animated compression visualization

## üçù Key Content Highlights

The landing page showcases these pasta-themed memory compression concepts:

### Functions & Variables
- `compressAlDente()` - Perfect compression texture
- `semanticSpaghetti` - Intertwined semantic nodes
- `vectorLasagna` - Layered vector embeddings
- `parmesanIndex` - Hash indexing that brings it all together

### Memory Kitchen Recipes
1. **Marinara Compression**: Slow-simmered context compression
2. **Carbonara Retrieval**: Rich, creamy context retrieval
3. **Pesto Indexing**: Fresh hash-based indexing

### The Philosophy
Demonstrates how memory compression is like Italian cooking - it's about preserving essence, creating connections, building traditions, and serving up wisdom.
